Scrivere un readme adeguato

If you don't want to install ROS2 Humble on your machine then you can use this repo.
You just need to clone it and use the current folder as a ros2 workspace.
Then use the make commands to build and run your packages.
You just need to install docker and docker compose.
Say me thank you.
